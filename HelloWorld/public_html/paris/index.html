            <h2>A weekend on the Seine</h2>
            
                <p>I was lucky enought to spend there three dayÂ´s visiting Paris this</br> month! I went with a friend and we were able to see many things while we were there!</p>
            
            <h4 id="day1">Day 1</h4>
            
                <p>On our first day, we started by visiting <em>Montmartre</em> right away.</br> Our second stop was the Eiffel Tower (check out that beautiful</br> picture!) We ate dinner at a cute little bistro overlooking <em>la</br> Seine</em>.</p>

            <h4 id="day2">Day 2</h4>
            
                <p>On our second day, we went shopping on <em>Avenue des Champs</br> Elysees</em>. Every single person we saw was dressed in the height of</br> fashion.
                    After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful</br> places! We went to <em>Notre Dame</em>. We went on a macaron tour of</br> Paris and ate all of the best macarons the city had to offer.</br> After we finished shopping, we visited <em>le Louvre</em>.</p>

            <h4 id="day3">Day 3</h4>
            
            <p>The picture below is of me visiting the <em>Arc de Triomphe</em>. It's</br> huge! We also went to <em>le Musee D'Orsay</em>. Seeing the work of</br> Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh in person was completely</br> breathtaking. I was surprised to see that the museum also had</br> many sculptures including those by Auguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin,</br> and Alfred Barye.</p>
